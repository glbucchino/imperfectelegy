            <p>An imperfect elegy.<br>
            A poem assembled for a boy who died.</p>
            <p>He was snatched away,<br>
            hit on the tracks in the middle of a warm July night while the aimless fires of youth<br>
            burned inside of him.</p>
            <p>This is an ode to a boy playing out the stories he read.<br>
            He was reckless and invincible,<br>
            a childhood spent inside a sunlit room surrounded by stacks of novels<br>
            with pages full of life being lived.<br>
            How many times had the image of a young man<br>
            tight rope walking on the tracks been shown to him?<br>
            He watched it and read it,<br>
            heard the tales from braver kids.</p>
            <p>He was twenty one when the train emerged from the darkness at a speed he couldnâ€™t register.<br>
            How fast does a train that kills a boy on the tracks go in the night?<br>
            How bright are the headlights when he meets their gaze?<br>
            How long is he a boy before he is dead?</p>
            <p>I was told the next morning on the phone, 3,000 miles away.<br>
            His death echoed throughout my history,<br>
            it settled on moments that were otherwise unremarkable like a fine dust,<br>
            a white ash,<br>
            a black night.</p>
            <p>How could I have seen the last moments of his life in a field of blowing flowers?<br>
            His footsteps around a ladder at dusk?<br>
            A sign in the brief illumination of a tree at night?</p>
            <p>I cannot go back and tell him what is to come.<br>
            I cannot grab him from the tracks or call him and tell him to go home.<br>
            I cannot photograph him resignedly,<br>
            tirelessly depicting the last years of a boy who will one day vanish from the world.</p>
            <p>I can arrange my photographs looking for meaning,<br>
            finding only the indelible traces he left behind.</p>
